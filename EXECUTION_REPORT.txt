=== NEEDPORT REBASELINE EXECUTION REPORT ===
Date: 2025-09-14T13:32:00+09:00
Branch: rebaseline/needs-post-minimal
Operation: Automated rebaselining of needs posting minimal flow

## Files Created/Modified:

### Database Schema & SQL Scripts
- supabase/sql/rebaseline_needs_minimal.sql (CREATED)
  - Adds required columns: status, published, owner_id
  - Creates set_owner_id() trigger function with auth.uid() casting
  - Implements RLS policy for authenticated INSERT
  - PostgREST schema cache reload

- supabase/sql/smoke_insert_need.template.sql (CREATED)
  - Template for smoke testing with ${USER_UUID} replacement
  - Sets JWT claim for auth context simulation
  - Tests minimal INSERT with title/body only

### Node.js Database Tools
- scripts/db/run-sql.ts (CREATED)
  - Generic SQL executor with variable replacement
  - Handles .env.local.tools for DATABASE_URL_ADMIN
  - Multi-statement support with error handling

- scripts/db/rebaseline-needs.ts (CREATED)
  - Orchestrator for schema application + smoke testing
  - Generates execution reports
  - UUID validation and error handling

### Package Configuration
- package.json (MODIFIED)
  - Added pg and @types/pg dependencies
  - Added db:apply:needs, db:smoke:need, db:rebaseline:needs scripts

### Environment Setup
- .env.example (MODIFIED)
  - Added DATABASE_URL_ADMIN documentation
  - Added feature flag section

- .env.local.tools.example (CREATED)
  - Template for admin database credentials
  - Security warnings for local-only usage

- .gitignore (MODIFIED)
  - Added .env.local.tools exclusion

### API Minimization
- src/app/api/needs/route.ts (MODIFIED)
  - Simplified to accept only {title, body} payload
  - Removed logging, request tracking, extended validation
  - DB insert relies on defaults/triggers for status/owner_id
  - Returns {id, title, created_at} format

### UI Simplification
- src/app/needs/new/page.tsx (MODIFIED)
  - Removed all conditional logic and feature flags
  - Form reduced to title and body fields only
  - Success redirect to /me instead of /needs/[id]
  - Minimal state management

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Database Trigger System
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.set_owner_id()
RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.owner_id := auth.uid()::uuid;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

### RLS Security Model
- needs_insert_policy: Authenticated users can INSERT with check (true)
- Owner ID auto-assignment prevents manual injection
- Draft status default ensures RLS compliance

### API Contract
- INPUT: {title: string, body: string}
- OUTPUT (201): {id: string, title: string, created_at: string}
- OUTPUT (400): {error: "VALIDATION_ERROR", details: {...}}
- OUTPUT (500): {error: "DB_ERROR"|"INTERNAL_ERROR", detail: string}

## Usage Instructions:

1. Setup admin credentials:
   cp .env.local.tools.example .env.local.tools
   # Edit DATABASE_URL_ADMIN with actual Postgres admin connection

2. Get user UUID from existing profiles table or auth.users

3. Execute automated rebaseline:
   USER_UUID=<actual-uuid> npm run db:rebaseline:needs

4. Expected output:
   - Schema migration applied successfully
   - Smoke test insertion completed
   - Result row with status='draft', published=false, owner_id=<uuid>

## Security Notes:
- .env.local.tools is Git-ignored (local admin credentials only)
- Production app continues using RLS-protected PostgREST
- Admin connection is for schema management only
- set_config() simulates auth context for smoke testing

## Status: READY FOR TESTING âœ…

All files created and configured for CLI-driven schema rebaselining.
Manual testing required with actual DATABASE_URL_ADMIN and user UUID.
=== EXECUTION REPORT ===
Date: 2025-09-14T14:18:41.635Z
Duration: 1031ms
User UUID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001
Operation: Rebaseline needs minimal posting flow

Files Changed:
- supabase/sql/rebaseline_needs_minimal.sql (applied)
- supabase/sql/smoke_insert_need.template.sql (executed with USER_UUID=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001)

Schema Changes Applied:
- Added columns: status (default 'draft'), published (default false), owner_id (references profiles)
- Created trigger: set_owner_id_trigger with set_owner_id() function
- Applied RLS policy: needs_insert_policy (authenticated users can insert)
- PostgREST schema cache reloaded

Status: SUCCESS âœ…
