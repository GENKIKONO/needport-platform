-- Post-Deployment Testing Queries

-- ============================================================================
-- Pre-Test Verification
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Check current state of profiles table

-- 3. Verify new need was created with proper owner_id
-- Run this AFTER posting a test need via the UI

-- Debugging Queries (if issues occur)
-- ============================================================================

-- 8. Debug: Check for needs without owner_id (should be empty after migration)

-- 9. Debug: Check for profiles without clerk_user_id (should only be legacy data)

-- Expected Results Summary
-- ============================================================================

/*
Expected Results After Successful Deployment & Testing:

1. ‚úÖ Latest Need Verification should show:
   - owner_id is NOT NULL
   - status = 'draft' 
   - published = false
   - owner_email matches the logged-in user

2. ‚úÖ Profile Auto-Creation Check should show:
   - Either existing profile OR newly created profile
   - clerk_user_id matches the Clerk user
   - email and full_name populated

3. ‚úÖ System Health Check should show:
   - profiles_with_clerk_id > 0
   - needs_with_owner >= needs count
   - needs_rls_policies = 4 (the policies we created)

4. ‚ùå Debug queries should show:
   - No needs without owner_id (except very old data)
   - RLS enabled on needs table
   - 4 RLS policies active

If any of these fail, check:
- Migration was applied correctly
- Clerk authentication is working
- ensureProfile() function is being called
- RLS policies are active
