# DB Check Example - E2E Test Results Verification

## Query (when authentication succeeds):
```sql
SELECT id, title, status, published, owner_id, created_at 
FROM needs 
WHERE title LIKE '[E2E]%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

## Expected Result Structure:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-generated-id",
  "title": "[E2E] Need Posting Smoke - 1726361710491",
  "status": "draft",
  "published": false,
  "owner_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "created_at": "2025-09-15T01:15:10.491Z"
}
```

## Verification Points:
✅ status = 'draft' (not published)
✅ published = false (not public)
✅ owner_id != null (properly assigned)
✅ title starts with '[E2E]' (test identification)

## Security Notes:
- owner_id is masked in logs for privacy
- Only test posts with '[E2E]' prefix are checked
- No modification queries, read-only verification
